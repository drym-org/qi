This module implements the Qi expander using Syntax Spec.  Here, we
notate the core language grammar from which Syntax Spec infers and
constructs an appropriate expander.  As part of this, we annotate the
grammar with binding scope rules (e.g. for the `as` form) which allows
the expander to propagate scope in accordance with these specified
rules and also raise errors at compile time when identifiers used are
unbound.

In addition to the core language grammar and scoping rules, we also
specify a few ad hoc expansion rules here (via Syntax Spec "rewrite
productions") in order to expand surface syntax that may not be neatly
expressible as a macro to an appropriate use of a core form. Such
rules are necessary so that the core language can be uniformly
expressed in terms of such prefix forms (it's similar to the Racket
core language's use of #%app, etc.).
