#|
The `flow` macro specifies the Qi language. In cases where there is
more than one expansion rule for a particular form of the language,
the expansion is delegated to a syntax class and a parser dedicated to
that form, so that the form is still represented as a single rule in
the flow macro, with the nuanced handling defined in the form-specific
parser.

The syntax classes for matching individual forms are in the
flow/syntax module, while the form-specific parsers are in the present
module, defined after the flow macro. They are all invoked as needed
in the flow macro.
